 * File role:
 *   Provides the reusable utils component used by pages or layout shells.
 *
 * Frontend context:
 *   Reusable React component layer: shared layout, maps, product metadata, protection wrappers, and UI building blocks.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *   Keep comments focused on state ownership, role-specific routing, API calls,
 *   and non-obvious UI decisions. Styling-only class names are left uncommented
 *   unless they communicate an important layout or accessibility choice.
